## Example for training a learning agent
*Take DQN as an example*

1. Implement your policy and train your agent on a given game level, shown in `train.py`. 
   
   *Example: `train.py` , game -> gold digger, level0*

2. Save your agent.  

	*Example: `best_model_gold_digger_lvl0.pkl`*

3. Agent class by load trained model.

   *Example: `Agent.py`*
